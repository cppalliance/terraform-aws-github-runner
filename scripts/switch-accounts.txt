Items to switch between prod and dev.

- Check credentials in ~/.aws/credentials. Switch to dev account.

- the file examples/multi-runner-cppal/secrets.auto.tfvars must be in place. It is customized and somewhat different between each account. Nearly all variables in that file are different.

- examples/multi-runner-cppal/templates/runner-configs/* . Switch between these with a script:

Main account:
ami_owners: [ "047402373783" ]

Test account, boost v2:
ami_owners: [ "254949769574" ]

To change this, run ./modify_ami_owners.sh.

- examples/multi-runner-cppal/templates/runner-configs/*  ami_filter varies. Execute dev_amis.sh or prod_amis.sh to switch between them.

- Use docker registry or not. This is handled automatically if DISABLE_DOCKER_REGISTRY has been set in the dev.pkrvars.hcl file in the images dirs.

- ssh keys vary. This should now be handled by ssh_keypair_name and ssh_private_key_file in the dev.pkrvars.hcl file in the images dirs when building packer images.

- in the script packerimages.sh set the variable such as build_environment=dev

- Run terraform normally, in either prod or dev. It will generate 'state', so deployments should be kept in completely separate directories at all times. However, the
  code may be synced, if all the above steps have been followed.
  Currently prod is using the main cppal account, and run in admin-server.cpp.al:/opt/github/cppalliance/terraform-aws-github-runner
  Dev is using the boost v2 aws account and run in localhost:~/github/samd2/terraform-aws-github-runner
